# **SPIKE RBD-ACE2 PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERFACE ANALYSIS**

This is the README file for the project carried out on the analysis of
energies between the **receptor-binding domain (RBD)** of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein and its receptor, **angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE2)**. In this document, you will find a detailed explanation of all
the files included in the final delivery of the work, as well as
instructions on how to perform the analysis.

The organization of this document is as follows. First, a detailed
explanation of all the documents containing the necessary data for
conducting the specific study will be provided. Subsequently, a brief
explanation of the codes used will be given, detailing the required
inputs and the provided outputs. Finally, the report will be
discussedVas well as the final outputs.

## [Included Files]{.underline} {#included}

In this section, all the documents and data necessary to carry out the
project will be discussed.

### Protein structure {#prostr}

`6m0j.pdb` File containing the structure of the complex formed by our
proteins of interest, downloaded directly from:
<https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J>.

`6m0j_fixed.pdb` File containing the structure of the complex formed by
our proteins of interest. It's the output of running the preparation
script and it's also the structure that we will work with.

### Parameters & Libraries {#parlib}

`aaLib_2.lib` Contains a table with information about the charge and
type of each atom of each residue. We updated this file because there
were some residues names within our structure that were not present in
this file.

`vdwprm` This file includes a table with all the necessary parameters to
calculate the Van der Waals interaction energy.

`NACCESS` Directory containing the `naccess` executable used to
calculate solvation energies. If it's the first time running the
pipeline, make sure to enter the directory and install `naccess` (you
can follow the instructions inside the file `BioPhys_README` ).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Code]{.underline} {#code}

At the outset of the code, one encounters a code block labeled
`customize parameters` . This is the section where the variables
mentioned must be explicitly defined to enable the proper functioning of
the code. Positioned at the beginning of the code, this segment is
designed for pre-execution modification, obviating the need to alter
variables midway through execution.

It is important to note that the **`base_path`** refers to the path
where the PDB structure is located, along with the aforementioned
parameters. However, the outputs generated by the code are saved in the
directory where the Jupyter notebook(code) is situated.

### Preparation & Data Curation {#prep}

Within this section, a curation of the provided structure takes place.
More specifically, non-contributing chains are excluded, and heteroatoms
(defined as any atom not belonging to the residues) are removed.
Subsequently, quality controls are implemented on the new structures.
Additionally, missing side-chains, hydrogen atoms, and atom charges are
incorporated. As an output from this section, an file is generated
containing the curated structure.

### Determine Interface Residues {#inre}

In this step, the interface residues, of the curated structure, from the
preceding section, are identified within a specified distance. This
distance is defined in the `customize parameters` section and must be
determined using `PyMol`. No external file is generated as output for
this section; however, a variable containing a list of interface
residues is obtained as a variable that will be used in the subsequent
section.

### Computing Interaction Energies {#inen}

In this section, the interaction energies are computed. On one hand, the
interaction energies concerning the interface residues (determined in
the previous step) are calculated, and on the other hand, the
computation is performed considering all residues. This separation is
conducted to conduct an analysis on the importance of interface
residues. As output from this section, two `.csv` files are generated:
one detailing the results for all residues and the other exclusively
incorporating the interface residues.

### Alanine-Scanning {#alsc}

In this final code segment, the alanine scanning is conducted to assess
the significance level for each interface residue. The output from this
process is a `.csv` document containing all the energy differences after
completing the study.

## [Results]{.underline} {#results}

FALTA POSAR EL REPORT AQUIII I COMENTAR QUE ES EL NSOTRE FINAL

`energies_all.txt` File generated after running `project(1).ipynb`.
Contains a table with all the energies (electrostatic, Van der Waals,
solvation of complex, solvation of chain A, solvation of chain G and
total) of all the residues of the complex.

`energies_int.txt` File generated after running `project(1).ipynb`.
Contains a table with all the energies (electrostatic, Van der Waals,
solvation of complex, solvation of chain A, solvation of chain G and
total) of all the residues that form the interface complex.

`ala_scanning.txt` File generated after running `project(1).ipynb`.
Contains a table with all the energies for all residues after being
replaced by ALA (one by one) that form the interface complex. There's a
row for each residue and a column for each energy.
